Slide!(puzzle):
One of the first puzzles that I played with as a child was a sliding puzzle. 15 "tiles" are arranged in a 4x4 grid,
and the aim is to rearrange them in specific order by sliding. This project was an attempt to recreate the same 
experience virtually, with possibility to add more pictures to the same mechanism. 

Conways Game of Life:
Sir John Horton Conway was a famous british mathematician. In 1970 he created a simulation known as "Conway's 
Game Of Life". Cells are arranged in a grid, cells can be either "dead" or "alive". According to the rules, cells 
can change thier state from alive to dead or vice-versa if certain conditions are met.

As the name sugests, this is a program meant for chess players or more specifically chess clubs. The program 
is meant for managing local ratings of players in the club. It calculates rating change based on the current FIDE
regulations. Unlike the others, this is coded in HTML & JavaScript.
